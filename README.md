# LoanApprovalSystem
This DAML-based loan system manages loan requests, approvals, token disbursements, and repayments. A loan limit contract enforces lending restrictions. Borrowers repay incrementally, and the bank archives the loan upon full repayment. The system demonstrates DAML workflows, validation, and token management.
